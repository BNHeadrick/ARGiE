An alternate reality game app for android that allows users to create and play alternate reality games. Traditional alternate reality games are managed by human placed clues, or people, throughout an environment and can be time consuming. This app aims to alleviate some of these issues. This app is a based off of a previous application (RadVenture) from myself, Mikhail Jacob, and Jeff Bernard. Initially, this was to be a fork of that application, but after major refactoring, it became clear that starting over would be less work moving forward. The goal of this application is to make an easy to understand, and use, game creator and player for alternate reality games. In addition to that, the 'puppetmaster,' or game manager, should have a limited role in managing the game after it's begun, or at the very least, have an easier time managing it by using this application. In ARG terms, this app should be, at least partially, the 'curtain' of the game that is to be leveraged by the puppetmaster. The end goal of this application is to have have games crowdsourced and located all over the world while giving the casual and serious user an easy way to find and play games, create and share games, and manage larger games if they want to perform that role. Feel free to fork, modify, and use this code however you want. If you do use my code, please just give me credit and abide by the MIT license stuff.
